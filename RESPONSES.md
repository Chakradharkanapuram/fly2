#### Support Email Response

[Hello,

I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble deploying your app. The message you're getting suggests that the deployment is failing due to an unhealthy allocation, which could be caused by a variety of factors, such as issues with your app's health checks or problems with the underlying infrastructure.

The cause of the Virtual Machine error can be determined by sharing the output of the 'flyctl logs' command and the 'fly.toml' file. A screenshot of the result of running "flyctl releases list" can also provide more insight into the source of the error, whether it be due to internal issues or resource limitations.

The issue of "pending v83 failed 
- Failed due to unhealthy allocations 
- not rolling back to stable job version 83 as current job has same specification" may be associated with the Virtual Machine count. The unhealthy allocation error suggests that the app started but was unable to pass our health check tests.

To help resolve the issue, I would suggest checking the following:

-Verify that your app's health checks are configured correctly and returning appropriate results.
-Ensure that the underlying infrastructure, such as servers and networks, are functioning as expected.
-Review the logs for your app to see if any error messages or other relevant information is being generated.

To help diagnose the issue, I have a few questions:

-What changes did you make to your app before attempting to deploy it?
-Do you have any health checks set up in your app, and if so, could you provide details on the health checks you have set up?
-Have you checked the logs for any errors or issues that may be related to this deployment failure?
Answering these questions may help us identify the root cause of the problem and find a solution. Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to helping you resolve this issue.

If you're still encountering issues after checking these items, please don't hesitate to reach out to us again with additional details or any further questions you may have. We're here to help.

Best regards,

Subject: Troubleshooting Steps for Deployment Failure Error

Dear [Customer Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I understand that you are encountering issues with your recent deployment, and I'd be happy to assist you in resolving this issue.

From your description, it appears that the deployment is failing due to unhealthy allocations with the following error message:

v83 is being deployed
c2258102: yyz pending
c2258102: yyz pending
c2258102: yyz running unhealthy [health checks: 1 total]
c2258102: yyz pending
c2258102: yyz pending
c2258102: yyz pending
c2258102: yyz pending v83 failed - Failed due to unhealthy allocations - not rolling back to stable job version 83 as current job has same specification.

To help resolve this issue, I recommend the following troubleshooting steps:




1)Review the health checks: The message suggests that the deployment is failing due to unhealthy allocations. Start by reviewing the health checks for your app to ensure that they are configured correctly and returning appropriate results.

2)Check the logs: Review the logs for your app to see if any error messages or other relevant information is being generated. This information may help you identify the root cause of the issue.

3)Verify infrastructure: Ensure that the underlying infrastructure, such as servers and networks, are functioning as expected. This could include checking for any issues with connectivity or resource availability.

4)Test previous versions: Try deploying a previous version of your app to see if the issue is specific to the changes you made. This can help you determine if the issue is related to the changes you made or if there are other underlying problems.

5)Verify basic solutions and use the 'flyctl status' and 'flyctl scale' commands to determine the Virtual Machine count.Suggest implementing automatic scaling of the Virtual Machines by using the command "flyctl autoscale set min=3 max=20".Gather further information on the problem through the 'https://fly.io/docs/reference/scaling/' link.

6)Implement the solution and check the status using 'flyctl status' and 'flyctl scale' commands.Monitor the app using 'flyctl logs' and 'flyctl releases list' to ensure that it's working as expected.

7)If you're still encountering issues after following these steps, consider reaching out to us for additional assistance. Provide as much detail as possible about the issue, including the error message and any relevant information from the logs.

Hello there!

Thank you for reaching out and for using Fly for your app deployment.

Based on your description, it appears that there might be an issue with your app deployment in the two regions that you've deployed to. It's great to hear that your app is working fine locally.

To troubleshoot this issue, here are some steps that you can try:

1)Check the logs of your app deployment in the two regions to see if there are any error messages. This can give you more insight into what might be causing the 503 status code errors.

2)Ensure that your app is running with the correct configuration and that all necessary environment variables are set.

3)Examine the logs in 'flyctl logs' to identify any problems.Verify the health of the running Virtual Machines using the 'flyctl status' command.

4)Try a test deployment in a different region to see if the issue is isolated to just the two regions you've deployed to.

5)Make sure that your app is not exceeding the resource limits set by Fly, such as the CPU and memory limits.

I hope these steps help you troubleshoot the issue with your app deployment. If you still have trouble, please feel free to reach out to Fly's support team for further assistance.

The next step is to review the Fly platform documentation for guidance. This documentation will provide information on the possible causes of 503 errors and steps you can take to resolve the issue. The following link will take you to all the available documentaion https://fly.io/docs/

Best regards,
